                There are many things to consider when purchasing a treadmill, such as your budget, your fitness goals, and how much space you have in your home. Some key features to look for when shopping for a treadmill are workout programs, speed settings, incline/decline settings, belt size, and folding options.

                I LIVE IN AN APARTMENT. WILL A TREADMILL BE TOO LOUD?

                Noise levels will vary by treadmill, but in general, treadmills are not too loud. You can certainly have a treadmill in an apartment without bothering your neighbors. If noise and vibration are a concern, you can place a shock-absorption mat underneath your treadmill to prevent vibration and sound from travelling.

                IS TREADMILL RUNNING EASIER THAN RUNNING AT THE SAME SPEED OUTDOORS?

                Treadmill running may feel more taxing, but physiologically it’s actually a bit easier than running outdoors. In his book Treadmill Training for Runners, Rick Morris explains, “Running on the treadmill, you don’t have to overcome the effects of wind resistance and you also have that assistance of a moving belt doing part of the work for you.” To more closely simulate road running, set your treadmill’s incline at one or two percent.

                CAN I TRAIN ON A TREADMILL FOR A ROAD RACE?

                You can train for a road race mostly on a treadmill, saysJenny Hadfield, coauthor of Running for Mortals and Marathoning for Mortals and a runnersworld.com columnist. But you’ll have to make a few tweaks. For starters, be sure to increase the incline and run “hills” on the treadmill once or twice a week. And because treadmill belts offer a relatively soft landing, take steps to prepare your body for racing on asphal

                ARE TREADMILLS “EASIER” ON YOUR BODY THAN RUNNING OUTDOORS?

                In general, running on a treadmill is less stressful on the body than running outdoors. John Post, the medical director for TrainingBible Coaching, explains that the treadmill absorbs a significant amount of impact, sparing your body. On the other hand, he says, “The downside is that it doesn’t condition the shock-absorbing musculature of the lower extremities like road running does.” Result: Over the long term, heavy treadmill use may actually leave you more prone to injuries like stress fractures.

                WHY DO TREADMILLS USE “MPH” WHEN RUNNERS PREFER MINUTES PER MILE?
            </AccordionItemButton>
        </AccordionItemHeading>

            <p>
                Most treadmills offer both readings of miles per hour and minutes per mile. Manufacturers include mph because beginners or casual treadmill users may not be familiar with the concept of minutes per mile, which is the measure preferred by experienced runners.
